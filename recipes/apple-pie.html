    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This easy apple pie was my mother's recipe. I make this simple recipe for
      homemade pie all the time; I love it. I often add a dash of nutmeg, so you
      can put that in if you wish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>6 cups thinly sliced apples</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Line a 9-inch pie dish with one pastry crust; set second one aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add more sugar if
        your apples are tart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer apple slices in the prepared pie dish, sprinkling each layer with
        cinnamon-sugar mixture. Dot top layer with small pieces of butter. Cover
        with top crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pie on the lowest rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce
        oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking
        until golden brown and filling bubbles, 30 to 35 minutes more. Serve
        warm or cold.
      </li>
    </ol>
